## Digital Clock

![Clock gif](clock.gif)

Made this digital browser clock using vanilla javascript by referring to [code with harry](https://codewithharry.com/videos/javascript-tutorial-in-hindi-in-one-video-2020) javascript tutorial which uses ```Date()``` object and their methods to show the time. It also shows times ‚è≥ of different cities of the world üåç  

## To Do List

![ToDoList gif](todo.gif)

Made this browser to do list using vanilla javascript by referring to [code with harry](https://codewithharry.com/videos/javascript-tutorial-in-hindi-in-one-video-2020) javascript tutorial which uses ```localStorage``` to store the item title and its description. Also added a search feature in the nav bar to easily search any task in the list. If you want to add any other feature and contribute to the repository, you can create a pull request üòâ I will be more than happy to merge it!
